## AutoAMP (work in progress)

**AMP** = **A**lan's **M**aintenance **P**rogram
**Auto** for having the ability to **auto**matically run everything on a set schedule

## About

This program is not finished. It's just a GUI with non-functional buttons at this point.

It will be based loosely on a shell script I wrote a while ago, which ran routine tasks on Linux.

These are things that need to be done, but aren't fun to do manually: software updates, virus scans, and file backups.

Currently, it is not able to do anything because I haven't implemented the actions that the buttons should correspond to.
So it's basically a preview of what it will eventually be.

My original shell script performed software updates, network diagnostics, and virus scans. It should be easy enough to port those features over. However, I have yet to implement the other features, such as backups or scheduling.

There will eventually be different versions for macOS, Linux, and Windows. The GUI will be the same (JavaFX), and they will all do roughly the same things, but with different implementation details.

It is currently a BlueJ project, but I will convert it to a more traditional project in a normal IDE like NetBeans or Eclipse.

MainFX is the entry point.
