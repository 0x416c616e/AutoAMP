##AutoAMP

**AMP** = Alan's Maintenance Program
**Auto** for having the ability to automatically run everything on a set schedule

This program is not finished. It's just a GUI with non-functional buttons at this point.

It will be based loosely on a shell script I wrote a while ago, which ran routine tasks on Linux.

These are things that need to be done, but aren't fun to do manually: software updates, virus scans, and file backups.

Currently, it is not able to do anything because I haven't implemented the actions that the buttons should correspond to.
So it's basically a preview of what it will eventually be.

My original shell script performed software updates, network diagnostics, and virus scans. It should be easy enough to port those features over. However, I have yet to implement the other features, such as backups or scheduling.
